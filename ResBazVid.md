# Pathway 2: Data Collection & Cleaning
- let's have a look at the second Learning Pathway that we termed "Data Collection and Cleaning". 
- Most research invovles data. 
  - You create it
  - Someone else created it
  - or a mix of these 
  - several sessions are dedicated to collecting data efficiently.


 # Qualitative
- maybe you want to create new empirical insights as part of your research 
- maybe you want to be running experiments or various kinds of studies there are few established software packages available to perform qualitative research efficiently 
- in this year's ResBaz we offer two sessions around Nvivo
  - the session and **Nvivo showcase** is right for you 
    - if you have either never heard of it 
    - or you might have opened it or even if you have already used it for a particular topic 
    - but now you want to see what else is possible 
  - the second NVivo session **"NVivo for literature reviews"** is all about what the title says:
    -  and it shows you efficient processes of integrating Empirical research with the literature
- Another important piece of software for data collection is Qualtrics
  - Qualtrics is an often employed product with a strong focus on surveys and customer experience
  - an overview will be provided in the session **introduction to qualtrics for research surveys** 
    - Qualtrics will also be used in the session **collecting sensitive research data** 
      - remember, there are several ways in which research data can be sensitive 
      - for example if it involves human participants 
      - while you might want to maximize their anonymity research interests or ethics might require you to keep track of some aspects of your participants or their responses 
      - how to achieve that is the core of this session


# Tidy Data
- moving on, we now have gotten to know sessions that support you with data collection. 
- Even with good intentions or ingesting data from trusted sources, that data might need to be *modified*
- that's especially true if you want to leverage computers to help you with that data's use
- More often than not this *modification* that I just mentioned is Data Cleaning or Wrangling
- To share a secret, not many peoples' love such tasks
- but these are often very necessary
- So, if you attend some of these sessions we will talk about soon, you might get these tedious tasks out of the way more efficently

- the session **Keeping your spreadsheets tidy** is a good introduction to the overall topic and makes this a bit more tangible
- Building up on that, you will be introduced to free and very neat tool called open refine  in the session **introduction to cleaning and transforming data with open refine** 
  - and for the case that you are already an R user we have the session **tidyverse and Beyond key tips for existing R users** on offer 


# Pathway 3: Publications, Engagement & Impact
- Our thrid and final Learning Pathway is  **Publications, Engagement & Impact** 
- let's talk about what some consider the *currency of research*: *publishing*
- but before we publish and even after we have to consider several aspects 
- let's talk about these in the sequence how you might encounter them when you are performing your research
- a famous saying goes *an image says more than a thousand words* so you might want to tie in a neat visualization to improve your publication's narrative 
  - and on a side note we have several ResBaz sessions about visualization on offer
  - one great way of seamlessly integrating visuals into your publication is presented to you in the session **Digital Storytelling with KnightLab** 
  - so for your research you might have spent ages on refining it and our output which is in many cases just the PDF file should reflect that it should look awesome one set of tools for this purpose has been around for decades some fear its name: LaTeX, Ley-tech and want to stick with Micosoft Word etc.
  - But, we have three sessions on offer that hopefully will convince you to become a LaTeX user.
    whichw tool trying to rule them all quarter and she will be introduced to it in the session authoring collaborative research projects in quarto some aspects of quarto such as Automation and reproducibility at the heart of the topics that we'll talk about next so let's assume we have nailed our paper writing we have those beautiful documents but we need to get them out there firstly you have to decide what is a good Journal help for that and to get an overview how the publishing process usually unfolds is provided in the session strategic publishing deciding where to publish and understanding the process one flavor of publishing that is becoming more and more important is open access in the session Open Access how to make your Publications open you will be familiarized with the basics but getting our work out there by publishing alone isn't enough we want to maximize impact and we want to promote our work the focus of the sessions using researcher profiles and social media to promote your research is helping you with online identities and established Outlets or you don't want to exclusively rely on such external commercial media outlets in the session build a research portfolio website using GitHub you will get hands-on experience with creating your own website to Showcase your work foreign [Music]
